Make an android app with the following requirements: 

1. Create an activity “A” with a button with text “Show Options”. 

2. On click of this button, pass the following URL to next activity (Activity “B”). 

https://hub.dummyapis.com/ImagesList?text=Test&noofimages=10&height=120&width=120 

3. Inside “B” activity, make an API call to the URL received from Activity “A” and fetch the response. 

4. After getting URLs of images in results, show the images in a ListView inside Activity “B” 

 

Good to have: 
1. Write clean code with variable names stating their purpose. 

2. Try to follow MVVM design pattern 

3. Try to follow OOPS (Avoid writing all code inside Activity) 

 

NOTE: 
Please do all your work in a GitHub Repo.
